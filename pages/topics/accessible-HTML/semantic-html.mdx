# Semantic HTML

Avoid DIV soup!
- Show an example (inspired by Rippling)

Elements with more functionality: <input> <button> <textarea> <a>

Landmark elements have semantic meaning AND functionality in assistive tech (aside, footer, header, etc.)
- Mention aria labeling on nav/section
Headings and structure
When to use nav and anchors vs. unordered lists
Show the VO rotor, Accessibility Insights
Explain using CSS classes to style things while using the right element (e.g. h2)
Forms
- Labeling inputs/textareas/etc.
    - Explicit and implicit pairings (when for is not required)
- Only certain elements can be labeled/named
- How and when to use visually-hidden class (punt on aria-label until later)

Buttons
- Compare button to DIV button
- Focusability, role, events (div[aria-label] in Jon's example isn't needed - but test it)
- Compare button to link
