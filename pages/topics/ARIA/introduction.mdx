# What is ARIA?

ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications. It's a standard set of attributes for plumbing accessibility information through web applications. 

ARIA shouldn't be the first thing you reach for: it's an advanced tool. That's because it's easy to mess up, which I have done. Fortunately, the developer tools we use today make it a bit easier to highlight potential problems with ARIA usage. However, it's imperative to test your markup with ARIA attributes on it to make sure things are working as intended.

HTML and ARIA work very closely together. Both standards affect how HTML tags become objects in the rendered output in a browser. You can think of accessibility information in semantic HTML elements as built-in, while ARIA attributes get bolted-on.

The current version of ARIA is 1.2: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/

> ⚠️ Please reference the standard when applying ARIA to your web pages and make sure you're using it correctly. Slapping on some attributes that you _think_ might work but not testing them in Assistive Technology can actually make things worse. ⚠️
