Who to follow in accessibility

## Accessibility expertise: a way to stand out from the crowd

Today's job market is tough. Every applicant has varied experience to bring to the table. If two candidates have equal experience except one is stronger in accessibility, a hiring manager might observe an advantage.

I've recently seen some employers prefer accessibility certifications (IAAP certifications, Trusted Tester, etc.). I haven't personally gone for it as I have adequate industry experience (and I'm back in a general webdev role). For specialized accessibility roles, however, certs can be a way to stand out from the crowd in a competitive job market.

Find your strengths and bring them to the table. Find how you can improve access while getting results that move an organization's mission forward.

I want to encourage you to apply accessibility even if you have to swim upstream. It isn't always easy to do the right thing when entire organizations around you don't believe in it. But I believe in the importance of access, and I believe in you.

Thank you for joining me in this workshop!
