# Focus Management Exercise

Let’s add focus management to a chat widget!

Chat widgets are all over the web, and they have some unique focus management concerns. When a chat widget or other layer opens, we need to send focus into it. When it is closed, we need to restore focus where it was.

Chat widgets could mostly be considered non-modal dialogs. This means that we don’t trap focus in the layer, so elements in the background should stay interactive. A skip link or keyboard shortcut to reach the chat widget could be helpful depending on where in the DOM the widget is located.
