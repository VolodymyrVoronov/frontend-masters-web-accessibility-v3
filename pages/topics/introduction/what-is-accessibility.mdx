# What is Accessibility?

Accessibility ensures that all people—regardless of ability—can interact with the information or services you provide. In the digital environment, accessible software can enable a person with a vision, hearing, or other disability to participate in and contribute to the web.

## The stakes and cost of inaccessibility

## Accessibility wins

## Statistics, types of disabilities

## The web is mostly accessible by default - don't mess it up

## Technical and design debt is hard to overcome. Reasons we need to:
- Civil rights. (This should be enough!)
- Legal issues
- Business cases. Larger reach, business opportunities, risk of losing business

## Accessibility expertise: a way to stand out from the crowd
